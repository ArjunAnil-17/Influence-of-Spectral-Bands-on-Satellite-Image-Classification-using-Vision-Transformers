In this paper, we explored the influence of the spectral bands in image classification using the Vision Transformer (ViT). Convolution is a local operation, and a convolution layer typically models only the relationships between neighborhood pixels. Transformer is a global operation, and a transformer layer can model the relationships between all pixels. This motivated us to use ViT for satellite image classification. Sentinel-2 EuroSAT image dataset, which consists of 27,000 images in ten classes, is used for the experiment. ViT model is trained with three band dataset, Red-Green-Blue (RGB) and compared with ViT model trained with RGB along with Near InfraRed (NIR) and with multispectral satellite image dataset (13 bands). Experimental results shows that NIR band combined with RGB was able to produce more accurate results comparing to RGB alone, whereas 13 band dataset outperformed both RGB and RGB & NIR datasets.
